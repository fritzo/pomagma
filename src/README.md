- Simplifier - coordinates guides, dispatches information, records routes
- Linguist - develop vehicles for various terrain
- Language Reviewer - ensure new vehicles will be safe for future traffic patterns
- Theorist - propose new routes between common destinations
- Theory Reviewer - evaluates transportation bills

Workflows
---------

- Compile: interpret laws to decide city extents and create surveying strategies
- Survey: select a region; survey it; aggregate measurements into atlas
- Write: travel around Abstractland with a guide
- Learn Language: optimize vehicles based on driving history
- Make Language: invent new parts for vehicles; review for safety
- Theorize: propose new routes; evaluate economic effects; legislate
- Recover (after Fregean collapse): assess damage; pinpoint problem; rebuild
