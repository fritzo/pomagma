- Compiler - decides city extents and creates surveying strategies
- Surveyors - explore and measures uncharted territory
- Cartographers - direct surveyors and incorporate surveys into the atlas
- Simplifier - coordinates guides, dispatches information, records routes
- Linguist - fits language to corpus and proposes new terms
- Language Reviewer - ensure new language modifications are safe
- Theorist - propose new routes between common destinations
- Theory Reviewer - evaluates transportation bills

Workflows
---------

- Compile: interpret laws to decide city extents and create surveying strategies
- Survey: select a region; survey it; aggregate measurements into atlas
- Write: travel around Abstractland with a guide
- Learn Language: optimize language weights based on corpus
- Make Language: propose new terms to add to the language; review for safety
- Theorize: propose new routes; evaluate economic effects; legislate
- Recover (after Fregean collapse): assess damage; pinpoint problem; rebuild
