# Cursor Rules for Pomagma

## NEVER DELETE OR RELAX TESTS

- Do not delete tests, test cases, or test data unless the user explicitly asks you to remove them.
- Tests are critical documentation of expected behavior and should be preserved.
- When encountering test failures, investigate and fix the underlying implementation rather than removing the failing test.
- If you need to modify a test, explain why and ask for permission first.
- Do not relax pytest.mark.xfail to pytest.mark.skip
- Do not relax timeouts
- Do not weaken hypothesis test generators

## Be efficient

- Try to avoid `make clean` as it requires a complete slow rebuild
- If you absolutely need to clean then build, try combining commands, e.g.
  `make clean && make debug`
