# Pomagma

An atlas of Abstractland.

## System Architecture

![Architecture](doc/architecture.png)

### State

- Law - XXX
- Vehicle - known means of navigating Abstractland
- Physical Atlas - a knowledge base of a prior facts about Abstractland
- Cultural Atlas - a knowledge base of humankind's presence in Abstractland

### Actors

- Strategist - finds optimal legal surveying strategies
- Surveyor - explores and measures uncharted territory
- Cartographer - directs surveyors and incorporates surveys into the atlas
- Vehicle - carries passengers on tours through Abstractland
- Mechanical Engineer - optimizes vehicles for specific terrain
- Materials Engineer - develops new modes of transportation
- Civil Engineer - carefully constructs roads between common destinations

### Workflows

- Strategize: find optimal legal surveying strategies
- Survey: select a region; survey it; aggregate measurements in atlas
- Tour: travel around Abstractland visiting significant destinations
- Work on vehicle: ...
- Develop new vehicle: ... legalize them
- Build new roadways: ...
- Theorize: conjecture new equations from data in structure
- Recover (after Fregean collapse): assess damage; pinpoint problem; rebuild

## Progress

- Prototyped - prove concept [DONE](http://github.com/fritzo/Johann)
- Parallel - run surveyor system tests (h4, sk, skj) DONE
- Scalable - implement cartographer DONE
- Distributed - run survey workflow on ec2
- Interactive - implement vehicle as web-app
- Persistent - record routes in cultural atlas
- Adaptive - tune vehicle based on routes
- Productive - build new roads based on travel patterns
- Reflective - locate agents within Abstractland
